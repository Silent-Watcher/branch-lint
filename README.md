A CLI tool to validate Git branch names using [Conventional Branch](https://conventional-branch.github.io/) guidelines. This package ensures that your branch names follow consistent naming conventionsâ€”supporting core branches like main, master, and develop, as well as structured feature, bugfix, hotfix, and release branches.

## Installation

Install the package globally using npm:

```sh
npm install -g validate-branch
```

Or add it as a development dependency in your project:

```sh
npm install --save-dev validate-git-branch
```

## Usage

### Command Line
Once installed, run the CLI command in your Git repository:

```sh
validate-branch
```

The tool will fetch the current Git branch name and validate it against the conventional naming rules. If the branch name is valid, you'll see a success message; otherwise, an error message will guide you to use the correct format.

## Git Hooks Integration

You can integrate this tool with Git hooks to enforce branch naming on every commit or push. For example, using Husky:

```sh
npx husky add .husky/pre-push "validate-branch"
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

Your branches should follow one of the following patterns:
- Core Branches:
 	- `main`
 	- `master`
 	- `develop`

- Feature, Bugfix, and Hotfix Branches:
  - `feature/branch-name`
  - `bugfix/branch-name`
  - `hotfix/branch-name`

- Release Branches:
 	- `release/branch-name`
 	- Release branches may include dots (e.g., release/v1.2.0)

The tool uses a refined regular expression to ensure that only the proper characters and structure are allowed for each branch type.
